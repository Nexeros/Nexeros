# Hi, I’m Pica
## I'm a student, programmer, and researcher passionate about computer science, robotics, electronics, physics, and more. My work spans from low-level programming and embedded systems to web development, AI, and data analysis.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find me as N04X9 (Nexeros) – a name I use as a personal brand, while Pica is my nickname (short for Picasso 🎨). Think of it as two sides of the same coin: Pica the individual, N04X9 the “lab” where ideas take shape.

I contribute both academic and hobby projects, and I often run them on my own infrastructure, which I also share with others in the community.

### I will appreciate any support
